Solving popular physics problems numerically.
This repo contains the following problems in physics solved by Central Difference Scheme, a numerical methods to solve second order differential equations.
  1) Simple Harmonic Oscillator.
  2) Duffing Oscillator
  3) Particle in a Box
  4) Quantum Harmonic Oscillator.
In addition to the above, there are also programs demonstrating some Chaos theory problems
  1) The Bifurcation Problem.
  2) Lorenz System of Equations.
